Simple Flask demo, copied and modified from https://github.com/GhostUser/IRIS-classification-flask-api

What has been added:

* Strongly modified Flask app structure, following tutorial here: https://pythonise.com/series/learning-flask/flask-application-structure

* predict_api_file in the flask app, so that now we can predict a whole CSV file

TODO

* add CI/CD pipeline

* add unit tests

* use mock in tests?

* add mlflow tracking and model registration

* containarize the flask app: follow https://pythonise.com/series/learning-flask/building-a-flask-app-with-docker-compose (seems more advanced than usual containarized Flask setups)
